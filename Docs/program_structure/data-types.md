# MessyLang data-types

## What is a data-type?

A data type is the type of a value, for example a value can be a number, a string...

### Number

A number is well, a number. Nothing more to say about it.

### String

A string is ALWAYS enclosed by double quotes `"`, and is a piece of text which may only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes `-`, and underscores `_`.

### Bool

A boolean is a value which may be only true or false, which is used only in `if` conditions.
